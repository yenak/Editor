# Editor
This is a text-editing program written in Java.

You can open the editor through the terminal by being in the repository directory and calling:

__javac src/*.java__

__java -cp src/ Editor file_name.txt__

The first command compiles the files, and the second runs the program. Replace __file_name.txt__ with the file you wish to edit or create.

# Features
* Open files or create a new one
* Save using __CTRL + S__
* Can move cursor with arrow keys or mouse
* Can also move cursor to beginning or end of line using __HOME__ and __END__ respectively
* Scrollbar on the right side of the window
* Word wrap
* Can resize the window and have the text move accordingly
